General Rules & Design Philosophy
All designs must be beautiful, not cookie cutter, and worthy for production. The UI should be user-centric, simple, and highly accessible. Prioritize clarity and avoid visual clutter.

Technical Stack: Use JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other UI packages unless absolutely necessary.

Visual Identity: A mobile-first design approach is mandatory. The app should have a defined, cohesive look and feel with a consistent color palette and typography chosen for readability.

UI Elements:

Schools dropdown: Only includes {Select your School, British School Muscat (BSM)}.

Year Group dropdown: Only includes {Year 5 - Year 11}.

The curriculum option is removed completely.

The Subjects management page (in SETTINGS) has only two buttons: Add Subject and Use School Subjects.

All Modern Foreign Languages (MFL) must be chosen via a popup modal.

All subjects are batch-inserted (atomic insert), with no duplicates allowed.

Existing subject rows retain edits (color, 'Has book?' toggle, teacher, room).

The subject row format must be: [colour] [subject] Has book? [toggle] teacher [icon] location [icon].

Content: Do not generate any subjects beyond the lists provided. Do not alter UI sections not explicitly specified.
